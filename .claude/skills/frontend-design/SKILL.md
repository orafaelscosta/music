# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. It implements real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build, potentially including context about purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme (brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.)
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

### Typography
Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt for distinctive, characterful choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### Color & Theme
Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

### Motion
Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML; use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments—one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.

### Spatial Composition
Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements, generous negative space OR controlled density.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere and depth. Add contextual effects and textures matching the aesthetic (gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays).

## What NOT to Do

**NEVER** use:
- Generic AI-generated aesthetics
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices. No design should be the same. Vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, and aesthetics. Never converge on common choices across generations.

## Implementation Note

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- Minimalist/refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well

**Remember**: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
